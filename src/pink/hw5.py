# 1)
# Create a function called "car_at_light"
# It should take one parameter: "light"
# which gives the color of a traffic light.
# If the color is "red", the function should return
# "stop". If the color is "green", the function
# should return "go". If the color is "yellow"
# the function should return "wait". If the color
# is anything else, the function should raise
# an exception with the following message: 
# "Undefined instruction for color: <light>" 
# where <light> is the value of the parameter light.
#

# 2)
# Create a function named "safe_subtract" that
# takes two parameters and returns the result of
# the second value subtracted from the first.
# If the values cannot be subtracted due to its type, 
# it returns None.
# If there is any other reason why it fails show the problem 
# 

# 3)
# Imagine you have a dictionary with the attributes of a person
# {'name': 'John', 'last_name': Doe, 'birth': 1987}
# {'name': 'Janet', 'last_name': 'Bird', 'gender': 'female'}
# create two functions that returns the age of the person
# that handles both examples.
# Name the first function "retrieve_age_eafp" and follow EAFP
# Name the second function "retrieve_age_lbyl" and follow lbyl

# 4)
# Imagine you have a file named data.csv. 
# Create a function called "read_data" that reads the file
# making sure to use to handle the fact 
# that it might not exist. 
#


# 5) Squash some bugs! 
# Find the possible logical errors (bugs) 
# in the code blocks below. Comment in each of them
# which logical errors did you find and correct them
### (a)
# total_double_sum = 0
# for elem in [10, 5, 2]:
#     double = elem * 2
#     total_double_sum += elem

# ### (b)
# strings = ''
# for string in ['I', 'am', 'Groot']:
#     strings = string+"_"+string

# ### (c) Careful!
# j=10
# while j > 0:
#    j += 1

# ### (d)
# productory = 0
# for elem in [1, 5, 25]:
#     productory *= elem
